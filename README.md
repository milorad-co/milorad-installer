# How to Install
## For Linux
For Debian-based Linux distros (such as Ubuntu, Linux Mint, MX Linux, Kali Linux, Pop!_OS, elementary OS, Zorin OS, Deepin, antiX, and KDE Neon), you can simply paste the following command block into your terminal:
```
git clone https://github.com/milorad-co/milorad-installer/
cd milorad-installer
chmod a+x milorad
sudo ./milorad
cd ..
rm -rfv milorad-installer
```
## For Windows
First, you must install [Git Bash for Windows](https://git-scm.com/downloads/win).<br>
Then, open Git Bash **as administrator**. Then run the following commands:
```
git clone https://github.com/milorad-co/milorad-installer/
cd milorad-installer
chmod a+x milorad
./milorad
cd ..
rm -rfv milorad-installer
```
## For MacOS
Milorad has not (and probably will never) make any applications for MacOS.
